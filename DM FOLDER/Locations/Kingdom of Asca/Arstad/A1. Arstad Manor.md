### A1a. Entrance Deck
> The entrance to the manor is grand. The walls tower two tall stories above ground to a large sloped roof with multiple peaks. There is a large tower on the right side of the manor with many large rounded windows shrouding the round stone walls. As you walk up to the large double doors, a butler greets you at the entrance to escort you into the interior of the manor. "Please, follow me," he says as he waves you inside.

The deck has railings lining the entirety of the 100 foot width and 30 foot depth. It is built of strong wooden planks and there are tables on either end of the deck with two chairs at each.


### A1b. Entrance Hall
>Stepping into the entrance hall, you are greeted with a sense of awe at the arched lofted ceilings fifteen feet above you. Down the middle of the hall is a long planter box filled with a variety of flowers that gather their sunlight from the large window above the main doors. Within the hall are a few people who's conversations had moved beyond the main room for the gathering.

The floor of the hall is white with a large gray square outlining the room at a diagonal with the center matching the color of the rest of the floor. On either side of the room are large paintings of past leaders of the household with a sword placed in front of it horizontally on a stand. 
- During the party, roll 2d4 to find how many people are talking inside the hall.


### A1c. Outdoor Pond
- Roll 1d4 to see if anyone is in this area when you enter it. If it is not during the party, if a 1, 2, or 3 are rolled, no one is there; if a 4 is rolled not during the party, Ella can be found sitting at one of the benches.

>Walking through the doors you discover a small enclosed pond outside the manor. There are benches on either side of it with a statue of a Kua-Toa spitting water into the center of the pond. 

Surrounding the pond are bushes and if a player makes a DC15 Perception Check in this area, they find scuffs in the dirt as if someone had jumped over the retaining walls of the pond area.

### A1d. Dining Hall
>In this room there is a large wooden table with four chairs on either side and a chair on each end. There are dinnerware laid out at each spot as though dinner was to be served but had not.

There is a large ash tray at the center and a cup at each chair, all empty. 

The center of the table has a rectangular silver plate with handles on either end with a red cloth on top and a decorative shell adorns it. There is nothing of value found here.

### A1f. Main Hall
>The grandeur of the main hall does not go unnoticed. With the near 50 foot diameter and 15 foot height for the size, with red, hardwood floor, the hall boasts a center stage with stairs up in the four cardinal directions to bring you up the four feet it is raised. To the Northwest side of the room, there is a long table in front of a large fireplace with 7 chairs around it. Filling the rest of the room are 4 round tables, each with 7 chairs surrounding them. There are windows on the exterior wall of the room every five feet with large curtains draped across them. To the right of the North doorway is a large upright double-layered organ.

**During the party**: There are many people in this room, adventurers and some nobles and merchants mixed together in this large room, men and women alike. Upon first entering this room, the Count will make an address to all in the room to enjoy the party.

>Count Tomas Von Arstad walks up to the center of the room and a hush befalls those gathered. "Thank you, adventurers, and welcome to my home. It is an honor to have such brave guests who would answer the call to battle in such dangerous times. It is due to your bravery and courage that we could protect the Arstad region and those in it from the monster wave from Dire Hollow. Please, eat, drink, and be merry, for you are heroes."

**Post party**: When entering this room for the first time after entering the manor, roll 1d4 to see how many servants are currently in the room cleaning. 

### A1g. Kitchen
