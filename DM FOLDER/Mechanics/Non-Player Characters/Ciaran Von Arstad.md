## Profile


**Ciaran Von Arstad is the second son to Tomas and Thea Von Arstad. He takes after his father in both his demeanor and skill with the sword. As he is not set to rule due to being the second in line to rule the Arstad Estate, he instead spends his time training to be the noble knight that he is.**
