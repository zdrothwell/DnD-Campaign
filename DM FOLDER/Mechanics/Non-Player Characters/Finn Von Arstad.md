## Profile


**Finn Von Arstad is the oldest child born to Tomas and Thea Von Arstad. Unlike his younger brother who spends his time training with the sword, Finn was instead trained in the ways of a noble. He spent many years at the Asca Grand Magic Academy training in magic and learning the decorum of nobles. He is set to take over the Arstad Estate when his father steps down from his position.**
